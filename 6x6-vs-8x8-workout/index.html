New Expedition Truck Project… 6x6 vs 8x8!!! Page 4 KATForum.de From kat-forum.de
Smaller areas like the biceps, triceps, and calves would only need two movements each. If you can&#39;t do all 6 sets with a strict 30 second break, reduce the weight until you can use shorter rest periods. Should you opt for a bodybuilding split, stick to three or four exercises for the larger muscle groups like legs, chest, and back. I think it was back in 2004.
