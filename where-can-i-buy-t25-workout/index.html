With t25 on the other hand, duration is shorter at 25 minutes each time. * with focus t25, you need to work out just 25 minutes a day to get in. Research proves that hiit can burn 28.5% more absolute fat mass than regular cardio ( 2019 ), improve vo2 max by up to 41% in eight weeks ( 2011 ), and burn just as many calories as classic cardio in less time ( 2014 ).
